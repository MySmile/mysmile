Themes
======

The new theme can be added manually by placing files in the appropriate directories

* ``apps/pages/templates/themes`` 
* ``mysmile/static/themes``  

In this case the name of new theme is added automatically into admin panel. Switching between themes can be done using 
the :ref:`preferenses <Preferences>`.
