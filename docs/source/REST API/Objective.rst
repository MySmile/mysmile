Objective
=========

REST API provides access to MySmile data. As a result it makes possible to create alternative UI design based for instance on `AngularJS <http://angularjs.org>`_ or even use as a part of `Wordpress <https://wordpress.org/>`_. For such purpose PHP and Java clients were created (Python client is on a way).
